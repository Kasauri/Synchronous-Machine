# Synchronous-Machine
Synchronous motors (SMs) are AC motors with constant speed.A SM dataset is obtained from a real experimental set. The task is to create the strong models to estimate the excitation current of SM.A SM dataset is obtained from a real experimental set. This dataset was further splitted to a test size of 30% and training of set of 70% for the training process randomly . The task is to create the best linear or quadratic form to estimate the excitation current of SM. The estimated excitation current is compared with the real value in the test dataset of SM. Three different regressors model was used for the machine learning process and a comparative study of the r2 score was carried out to determine the best model that could be used to estimate the EC.
